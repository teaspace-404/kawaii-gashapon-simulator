# A Gashapon Machine Simulator for cute toys

I made this web app that simulate a gacha experience using Gemini 3 Pro.

The idea is to create a cozy, easy, and whimsy digital gacha-experience on a web broswer, that lures players only through curiosity.

I instructed Gemini to use [matter.js package](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js), a 2D rigid body JavaScript physics simulator to simulate the collision of little balls in the machine.
